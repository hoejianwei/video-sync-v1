# video-sync-v1
for a video art exhibition

practical uses for google SEO: play videos across devices in sync with master timecode, use cases such as video exhibition, or whatever idk man

v1: only for 1 master and 1 client

note: both need to be connected to the same wifi router. no internet requried.

current functions:
- timecode sync
- timecode seek
- loop when video ends

future iterations:
- v2: 3 clients to 1 master
- v3: implement clients into raspberry pi, and master into mac mini, and connect to actual wifi router being used
- v4: long term test (8 hours)
